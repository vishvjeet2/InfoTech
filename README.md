Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop an Android application that functions as a timer. The app will utilize a foreground service to track elapsed time, enabling users to start, pause, and resume the timer seamlessly. A persistent notification will display the elapsed time, ensuring users can monitor the timer even when navigating away from the app.

Key Features

1.Start Timer
   - Users can initiate the timer through the app's user interface (UI).
   - A foreground service will be triggered to handle the timer's logic, ensuring that it runs continuously even if the app is minimized or in the background.
   - The elapsed time will be updated and displayed in the persistent notification.

2. Pause/Resume Timer
   - Users will have the ability to pause the timer via the appâ€™s UI or the notification.
   - When paused, the timer will stop updating the elapsed time, allowing users to resume it at any point without losing their progress.

3. Foreground Notification
   - A persistent notification will be displayed while the timer is running, showcasing the current elapsed time.
   - The notification will include actions for pausing and resuming the timer, providing users with quick access to timer controls without needing to return to the app.

Technical Approach:
- Architecture:
  - The application will be structured around an Activity for the UI and a Service to manage the timer functionality.
  - The service will operate in the foreground to ensure that the timer remains active and responsive.

- Technologies Used:
  - Android SDK (Java/Kotlin)
  - NotificationManager for managing notifications.
  - CountDownTimer or Handler for timing operations.

- User Interface:
  - The UI will consist of a simple layout with buttons for starting, pausing, and resuming the timer, along with a TextView to display the elapsed time.

- Persistence:
  - Data persistence mechanisms (such as SharedPreferences or a local database) can be used to retain the timer state across app sessions if desired.

Expected Outcomes:
- A fully functional Android Timer Application that allows users to effectively track time with features to start, pause, and resume the timer.
- A user-friendly interface that integrates notifications for enhanced user experience.

Target Audience:
This application is aimed at users who require a simple and efficient timer for various activities, including cooking, workouts, and time management tasks.


conclusion:
The Android Timer Application will serve as an effective tool for users to manage their time efficiently. By combining a robust backend service with an intuitive user interface, this project aims to deliver a seamless timer experience on Android devices.
